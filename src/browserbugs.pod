title: Workarounds for some known bugs in browsers.

=head1 Preventing QUERY_STRING from getting corrupted because of &entity key names

In a URL which contains a query string, if the string has multiple 
parts separated by ampersands and it contains a key named "reg", 
for example C<http://my.site.com/foo.pl?foo=bar&reg=foobar>, then 
some browsers will interpret C<&reg> as a magic entity and encode 
it as C<&reg;>.  This will result in a corrupted C<QUERY_STRING>.  
If you encounter this problem, then either you should avoid using 
such keys or you should separate parameter pairs with C<;> instead 
of C<&>.  Both C<CGI.pm> and C<Apache::Request> support a semicolon 
instead of an ampersand as a separator.  So your URI should look 
like this: C<http://my.site.com/foo.pl?foo=bar;reg=foobar>.

Note that this is only an issue when you are building your own URLs
with query strings.  It is not a problem when the URL is the result 
of submitting a form because the browsers I<have> to get that right.


=head1 IE 4.x does not re-post data to a non-port-80 URL

One problem with publishing 8080 port numbers (or so I have been 
told) is that IE 4.x has a bug when re-posting data to a non-port-80 
URL.  It drops the port designator and uses port 80 anyway.

See L<Publishing Port Numbers other than
80|config/Publishing_Port_Numbers_other_th>.
