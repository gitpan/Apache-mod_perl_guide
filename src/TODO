Stas,
In your performance tuning section- "Tuning with ab - ApacheBench" -
your first example has

             Non-2xx responses:      100

This is usually a sign that the script did NOT run successfully, so the
benchmark numbers for this
example are probably not meaningful.  Also, you might consider running
ab with the keep-alive flag (-k)
if it's enabled on the server (be sure to emit a content-length header)
as this has a significant impact on server performance in these types of
benchmarks.

Another suggestion might be to include a few results with static pages,
so it's easier to compare your
results against a common baseline.  It is my experience that a
well-tuned mod_perl + Apache server delivers dynamic pages from a mysql
DB around 50% as fast as it delivers static pages.  That is excellent
performance compared to a CGI implementation, which is typically 10-20%
as fast as a static page.
