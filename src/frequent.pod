title: Frequent mod_perl problems

=head1 Coverage

Some problems come up very often on the mailing list.  If you think
some important problem that is being reported frequently on the list
is not included below, even if it is found elsewhere in the Guide,
please L<tell me|help/Contacting_me>.





=head1 my() scoped variable in nested subroutines

See the section "L<my() Scoped Variable in Nested 
Subroutines|perl/my_Scoped_Variable_in_Nested_S>".



=head1 Segfaults caused by PerlFreshRestart

See the section L<Evil things might happen when using
PerlFreshRestart|troubleshooting/Evil_things_might_happen_when_us>

=head1 Problems with DSO

If you get the mod_perl binary package (i.e. RPM) and it doesn't work,
try and get a static install to work.  mod_perl DSO does not work
reliably.  If mod_perl is compiled statically into Apache, it just
works, and you don't need to configure the web server with anything,
and you'll probably need to comment out lines like "LoadModule ...".

Overview|strategy/mod_perl_Deployment_Overview>".
